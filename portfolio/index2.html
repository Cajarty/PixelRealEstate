                 Digital properties in PixelRealEstate are tradable blockchain tokens powered by Ethereum. Each property is a separate individual token, which can have its appearance altered to its owners desire. Where Bitcoin and Ethereum are cryptocurrencies, these are cryptocollectables. Cryptocollectables can be bought, sold, or traded like any collectable item.

                 PixelRealEstate uses MetaMask to communicate with the digital real estate marlet, which is run on a Smart Contract through Ethereum. 
                 MetaMask is a digital wallet for Ethereum, meaning your funds ar stored securely in this wallet, rather than you having to trust us with your
                 funds through our website. Remember, MetaMask is a wallet, so protect it. Your MetaMask passwords or seed words must be kept secret, but don't
                 lose them!
              </p>
              <p>
                 We suggest printing a paper copy off of your password and seed words, then putting it somewhere for safe keeping. 
                 <br/>
                 <strong>These cannot be recovered if you lose them.</strong>

                   PixelRealEstate are tradable, collectable, digital property. Where each cryptocurrency token is the same as the next (that is, each Bitcoin is is just like any other Bitcoin), each digital property is a unique, non-fungible token. These properties cannot be created, and each represent a different region on the digital real estate market.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   Each piece of digital real estate can be modified by its owner to change its appearance, allowing for property owners to customize their desired appearance, as well as change the hover text and clickable link of each property. This means that properties can be used to showcase art, advertise websites, or share images.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   Each piece of property can also be rented out, allowing owners who purchase property due to the expectation of equity growth to sit back and build equity while earning payments through renters.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   If a user does not feel up for purchasing an entire property, or would like to test the water first before purchasing, they can rent properties from other users on the system. While you rent a property from another user, you are given full control over the property, allowing users to fully maximize their use at a lower cost.

                 <li> PixelRealEstate is a Ethereum Smart Contract powered by the Ethereum network.</li>
                 <li>Each digital property is a unique, non-fungible token on Ethereum, which allows for it’s owner to change it’s display image, hover text, clickable link, as well as can be listed for sale or rent.</li>
                 <li>There are 10,000 unique properties in the PixelRealEstate digital property market. No new ones will ever be created, nor can any property ever be destroyed.</li>
                 <li>PixelRealEstate follows a sustainable income model, rather than an ICO. Each property will be available for purchase at launch, however the cost to purchase each property will go up incrementally with each sale.</li>
                 <li>The starting price for a digital property is 0.01 ETH. Every ten purchases, the price is increased by 0.001 ETH, with that incrementing value going up by 0.0005 ETH every ten purchases as well. This pushes an upwards pressure in the going property evaluation, pushing for sustainable equity growth in the investment of properties.</li>
                 <li>Properties in PixelRealEstate follow the free market after their initial purchase. Similar to the values of regular properties, stamps or collectable cards, the price of a digital property in the future is determined by pure supply and demand.</li>
